example_test.py

This is an example of how tests should look like, see the class bellow for more info.

Every test should define, at least, two special methods:

- `set_test_params`: change default values for number of node, topology, etc.
- `run_test`: the test itself

Any attempt to define a test without these methods will raise a TypeError.

Other methods are available to do more things. Some of them make sense only in `set_test_params`
and others make sense only in `run_tests`. 

- `add_node_settings`: register a node settings to create a node after. A node will be a spawned
                       `cargo run --features json-rpc --bin florestad -- --network <chain>` process.
                       In summary, its a `FlorestaRPC` instance.
                       
                       The chain can be one of ["regtest", "signet", "testnet"].
                       You can pass some extra arguments with `extra_args` and it will be appended
                       to the process command. The `rpcserver` is a dictionary defining a "host",
                       "port", "username" and "password". The "data_dir" is optional and can be
                       used to create a temporary directory to store files. It will return an
                       integer pointing an index of a list of nodes.
                       
- `get_node_settings`: get a registered node settings

- `run_node`: run a node for a registered node settings at some index,
              configured with `add_node_settings`.

- `get_node`: get a resgistered running node.

- `wait_for_rpc_connection`: given a node index, wait for it to be available.

- `run_rpc`: our RPC is a MockUtreexod running on a thread.

- `stop_node`: given a running node at index, stop it.
               If any directory was created, it will be removed.

- `stop`: stop all registered nodes.

After the definition of test within a class, you should call `MyTest().main()` at the end of file.

# Just Recipes on Floresta.

In floresta we love to use [Just](https://just.systems/man/en/), its fast and a easy way to maintain scripts in the project.

To organize the recipes we take advantage of groups. 

You can see the groups by

```Bash
just # So you can see our welcome message! ;)
# or
just --groups
```

## Groups Overview

### Userland

Recipes that help users and consumers with long commands or repetitive tasks - a good example is the `install` recipe.

---

### Development

Project maintenance tasks - run these when preparing code for submission or cleaning up data directories.

#### Linting

Code quality checks - run these frequently to keep code clean and consistent. We recommend using `just lint` which runs most of our CI lint checks and formats the code. For a complete lint check use `just lint-features`. If you only want formatting, use `just fmt`.

#### Testing

End-to-end validation suites - run these to verify everything works as expected.

---

### Running

Build and Execute the application - use these for local testing and development.

---

### Utility

Helper recipes - these are made to support other commands.

## Extending and Maintaining Recipes.

You may have noticed that we like to maintain the set of groups concise and meaningful, the recipes have clear use-cases and none or low dependencies... Just like any scripting should be in this project.

You can nest groups for a command, the `install` recipe is included in `Userland` and `Build` group, and the `lint` one is included in `Linting` and `Development`.

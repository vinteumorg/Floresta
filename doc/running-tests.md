# Tests

This document is a guide for the different testing options available in Floresta. We have an extensive suite of Rust tests, as well as a functional tests Python framework, found in the [tests directory](../tests). For fuzzing tests refer to [this document](fuzzing.md).

## Requirements

The tests in `floresta-cli` depend on the compiled `florestad` binary. Make sure to build the entire project first by running:

```bash
cargo build
```

The functional tests also need some dependencies, we use python for writing them and `uv` to manage its dependencies.

Our tests also needs `utreexod` and `florestad` to test some functionalities. We offer a helper script to assist in this process and guarantee isolation and reproducibility. Since `go` is a requirement to build utreexod, make sure you have `go` available on your system.
See [Setting Functional Tests Binaries](#setting-functional-tests-binaries) for more instructions.

## Testing Options
There's a set of unit and integration Rust tests that you can run with:

```bash
cargo test
```

For the full test suite, including long-running tests, use:

```bash
cargo test --release
```

Next sections will cover the Python functional tests.

### Setting Functional Tests Binaries

We provide three way for running functional tests:
* from `just` tool that abstracts what is necessary to run the tests before doing a commit;
* from helper scripts — [prepare.sh](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/blob/master/tests/prepare.sh) and [run.sh](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/blob/master/tests/run.sh) — to automatically build and run the tests;
* from python utility directly: the most laborious, but you can run a specific test suite.

#### From `just` tool
It abstracts all things that will be explained in the next sections, and for that
reason, we recommend to use it before doing a commit when changes only the functional tests.

```bash
just test-functional
```

#### From helper scripts

We provide two helper scripts to support our functional tests in this process and guarantee isolation and reproducibility.
Since `go` is a requirement to build `utreexod`, make sure you have`go` available on your system.

* [prepare.sh](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/blob/master/tests/prepare.sh) checks for build dependencies for both `utreexod` and `florestad`, builds them, and sets the `$FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR` environment variable. This variable points to where our functional tests will look for the binaries — specifically at `$FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR/binaries`.

* [run.sh](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/blob/master/tests/run.sh) adds the binaries found at `$FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR/binaries` to your `$PATH` and runs the tests in that environment.

So a basic usage would be:

```bash
./tests/prepare.sh && ./tests/run.sh
```

By default, the tool will build `utreexod` on its latest commit on `main`
branch. If you want to build a specific commit, you can set the
`UTREEXO_REVISION` environment variable before running the script.
It may be a tag or a commit hash. For example:

```bash
UTREEXO_REVISION=0.1.0 ./tests/prepare.sh && ./tests/run.sh
```

Additionally, you can use some arguments in those scripts:

```bash
UTREEXO_REVISION=0.1.0 ./tests/prepare.sh --build && ./tests/run.sh --preserve-data-dir
```

The `--build` argument will force the script to build `utreexod` even if it is already built.
The `--preserve-data-dir` argument will keep the data and logs directories after running the tests
(this is useful if you want to keep the data for debugging purposes).

#### From python utility directly
Additional functional tests are available (minimum python version: 3.12).
It's not recommended to run them directly, since you will need to manually
build the binaries yourself and place them at `$FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR/binaries`.
The advantage is that you can run a specific test suite. For this you'll need to:

* Setup `floresta`/`utreexod` environment;
* Setup python utility;
* Run tests from python utility directly;
* Clean up the environment.

##### Setup `floresta`/`utreexod` environment

After build the `floresta` and `utreexod` binaries, you'll need to define
a `FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR` environment variable. This variable points to where
our functional tests will look for the binaries.

##### Setup python utility
* Recommended: install [uv: a rust-based python package and project manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

* Configure an isolated environment:

```bash
# create a virtual environment
# (it's good to not mess up with your os)
uv venv

# Alternatively, you can specify a python version (e.g, 3.12),
uv venv --python 3.12

# activate the python virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# check if the python path was modified
which python
```

* Install module dependencies:

```bash
# installs dependencies listed in pyproject.toml.
# in local development environment
# it do not remove existing packages.
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

# if you're a old-school pythonist,
# install from requirements.txt
# without remove existing packages.
uv pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

# Alternatively, you can synchronize it
# uses the uv.lock file to enforce
# reproducible installations.
uv sync
```

* Format code
```bash
uv run black ./tests

# if you want to just check
uv run black --check --verbose ./tests
```


* Lint code
```bash
uv run pylint ./tests
```

##### Run tests from python utility directly

Our tests are separated by "test suites". Suites are folders located in `./tests/<suite>` and the tests are the `./tests/<suite>/*-test.py` files. To run all suites, type:

```bash
FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR=<your_bin_dir> uv run tests/run_tests.py
```

You can list all suites with:

```bash
FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR=<your_bin_dir> uv run tests/run_tests.py --list-suites
```

To run a specific suite:

```bash
FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR=<your_bin_dir> uv run tests/run_tests.py --test-suite <suite>
```

You can even add more:

```bash
FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR=<your_bin_dir> uv run tests/run_tests.py --test-suite <suite_A> --test-suite <suite_B>
```

##### Clean up the environment

If you tests fails it will be necessary to cleanup the `data`
folder created by the tests (some tests use it to retain
information about tested nodes, like the `addnode` command).

You can do this by running:

```bash
rm -rf FLORESTA_TEMP_DIR/data
```

### Running/Developing Functional Tests with Nix

If you have nix, you can run the tests following the instructions [here](nix.md).

## Command line utility

This is a simple cli utility to interact with your node. To run it, just call

```bash
floresta-cli help # this will show all the available options
floresta-cli help <command> # this will show the help for the command including the usage and description
floresta-cli [<options>] <command> <args> #general command usage
```

We also have `man pages` that can be generated using the instructions outlined [here](../../doc/rpc_man/README.md).

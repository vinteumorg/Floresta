//! # Floresta Wire
//! This crate provides the core networking logic for a full node using libfloresta,
//! including the P2P network and the mempool. You can easily integrate it with any
//! other crate that provides a `BlockchainInterface` and `UpdatableChainstate`
//! implementation.
//!
//! A node also gives you a `handle` that you can use to send messages to the node,
//! like requesting blocks, mempool transactions or asking to connect with a given
//! peer.

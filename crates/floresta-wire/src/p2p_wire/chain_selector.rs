//! A module that connects with multiple peers and finds the best chain.
//!
//! # The theory
//!
//! In Bitcoin, the history of transactions processed by the network is defined by a sequence of
//! blocks, chainned by their cryptographic hash. A block commits the hash for the block right
//! before it. Therefore, if we pick any given block, there's exactly one history leading to the
//! very first block, that commits to no one. However, if you go in the other way, starting at the
//! first block and going up, there may not be only one history. Multiple blocks may commit to the
//! same parent. We need a way to pick just one such chain, among all others.
//!
//! To do that, we use the most work rule, sometimes called "Nakamoto Consensus" after Bitcoin's
//! creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Every block has to solve a probabilistic challenge of finding a
//! combination of data that hashes to a value smaller than a network-agreed value. Because hash
//! functions are pseudorandom, one must make certain amount of hashes (on average) before finding a
//! valid one. If we define the amount of hashes needed to find a block as this block's "work",
//! by adding-up the work in each of a chain's blocks, we arrive with the `chainwork`. The Nakamoto
//! consensus consists in taking the chain with most work as the best one.
//!
//! This works because anyone in the network will compute the same amount of work and pick the same
//! one, regardless of where and when. Because work is a intrinsic and deterministic property of a
//! block, everyone comparing the same chain, be on earth, on mars; in 2020 or 2100, they will
//! choose the exact same chain, always.
//!
//! The most critial part of syncing-up a Bitcoin node is making sure you know about the most-work
//! chain. If someone can eclypse you, they can make you start following a chain that only you and
//! the attacker care about. If you get paid in this chain, you can't pay someone else outside this
//! chain, because they will be following other chains. Luckly, we only need one honest peer, to
//! find the best-work chain and avoid any attacker to fools us into accepting payments in a "fake
//! Bitcoin"
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! In Floresta, we try to pick a good balance between data downloaded and security. We could
//! simply download all chains from all peers and pick the most work one. But each header is
//! 80 bytes-long, with ~800k blocks, that's arround 60 MBs. If we have 10 peers, that's 600MBs
//! (excluding overhead by the p2p messages). Moreover, it's very uncommon to actually have peers
//! in different chains. So we can optmistically download all headers from one random peer, and
//! then check with the others if they aggree. If they have another chain for us, we download that
//! chain, and pick whichever has more work.
//!
//! Most likely we'll only download one chain and all peers will agree with it. Then we can start
//! downloading the actual blocks and validating them.

//! During the lifetime of a Bitcoin client, we have a couple of phases that are slightly different
//! from each other, having to implement their own state-machines and logic for handing requests.
//! While we could simply put everything in one struct and have a single `impl` block, that would
//! create a massive amount of if's in the code, taking different paths depending on which state
//! are we in. For that reason, we define the basics of a node, like code shared by all the
//! states into one base struct called `UtreexoNode`, we then further refine this struct using
//! fine-tuned `Contexts`, that should implement [NodeContext] and are passed-in as a generic
//! parameter by the caller.
//!
//! The three flavors of node are:
//!  - ChainSelector:
//!    This finds the best PoW chain, by downloading multiple candidates and taking
//!    the one with more PoW. It should do its job quickly, as it blocks our main
//!    client and can't proceed without this information.
//!
//!  - SyncNode:
//!    Used to download and verify all blocks in a chain. This is computationally
//!    expensive and may take a while to run. After this ends its job, it gives us 100%
//!    certainty that this chain is valid.
//!
//!  - Running Node:
//!    This is the one that users interacts with, and should be the one running most
//!    of the time. This node is started right after `ChainSelector` returns, and
//!    will handle new blocks (even if `SyncNode` haven't returned) and handle
//!    requests by users.

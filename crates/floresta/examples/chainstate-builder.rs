//! In node.rs we created a node that connects to the Bitcoin network and downloads the blockchain.
//! We use the default chainstate, which starts at genesis and validates all blocks. This is
//! the simplest way to create a node, but you can also create a node that starts at a given
//! block, or that doesn't validate all signatures. All customizations are done through the
//! ChainStateBuilder struct. This example shows how to use it.

    // the block data after we validated it. This saves a lot of space, but it means that
    // we can't serve blocks to other nodes or rescan the blockchain without downloading
    // it again.
    let chain_store =

    // Create a new chain state builder. We can use it to customize the chain state.
    // Assume valid is the same as in node.rs, it's the block that we assume that all
    // blocks before it have valid signatures.
    //
    // Tip is the block that we consider to be the tip of the chain. If you want to
    // start the chainstate at a given block, you can use this. If you don't set it,
    // it will start at genesis.
    //
    // We also set the chain params, which are the parameters of the network that we
    // are connecting to. We use the Bitcoin network here, but you can also use
    // Testnet, Signet or Regtest.
    //
    // Finally, we set the utreexo accumulator. This is the accumulator that we use
    // to validate the blockchain. If you set the chain height, you should update
    // the accumulator to the state of the blockchain at that height too.

    // See node.rs for an example on how to do it ...

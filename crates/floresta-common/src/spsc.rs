/// A (Send + Sync) single producer, single consumer channel to notify modules about things.
/// The api is super minimalistic to reduce external dependencies, including from the std-lib
///
/// One notable difference from the standard mspc channel is that this channel's ends are't
/// two different types, while this is possible, there's no reason to do that. Specially
/// considering that to get a good compile-time asurance that both ends will not be shared, the
/// channel must not be [Send], but this is one of the main requirements to use this channel in
/// async code. Moreover, if two worker threads are meant to be identical threads balancing their
/// work, it might be beneficial to use this same channel as a de-facto single producer, multiple
/// consumer channel for work distribution.
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use floresta_common::spsc;
/// let channel = spsc::Channel::new();
///
/// // Send something
/// channel.send(1);
/// // Read the same thing back
/// assert_eq!(channel.recv().next(), Some(1));

/// channel.send(0);
/// channel.send(1);
///
/// for (i, el) in channel.recv().enumerate() {

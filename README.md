# Floresta

Welcome to Floresta: a lightweight Bitcoin full node implementation written in Rust and powered by [Utreexo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/611), a novel dynamic accumulator designed for the Bitcoin UTXO set.

This project is composed of two parts, `libfloresta` and `florestad`. `libfloresta` is a set of reusable components that can be used to build Bitcoin applications. `florestad` is built on top of `libfloresta` to provide a full node implementation, including a watch-only wallet and an Electrum server. If you just want to run a full node, you can use `florestad` directly, either by building it from source using the given instructions on the [doc folder](/doc) or by downloading a pre-built binary from the [releases](https://github.com/vinteumorg/Floresta/releases/latest).

## For developers

Detailed documentation for `libfloresta` is available [here](https://docs.getfloresta.sh/floresta/). Additionally, the [floresta-docs](https://josesk999.github.io/floresta-docs/) mdBook provides an in-depth look at the libraries' architecture and internals.

Further information can be found in the [doc folder](/doc).

## Consensus Implementation

One of the most challenging parts of working with Bitcoin is keeping up with the consensus rules. Given its nature as a consensus protocol, it's very important to make sure that the implementation is correct. Instead of reimplementing a Script interpreter, we use [`rust-bitcoinconsensus`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoinconsensus/) to verify transactions. This is a bind around a shared library that is part of Bitcoin Core. This way, we can be sure that the consensus rules are the same as Bitcoin Core, at least for scripts.

Although tx validation is arguably the hardest part in this process. This integration can be further improved by using `libbitcoinkernel`, that will increase the scope of `libbitcoinconsensus` to outside scripts, but this is still a work in progress.

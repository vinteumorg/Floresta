//! This module is used during Initial Block Download to keep track of which blocks have
//! we downloaded, requested or are still pending. We keep an internal cache of inflight
//! blocks, and the instant we requested it. If it have elapsed some time after the request
//! we assume it timed out and request again.
//! Since we ask blocks for multiple peer, they might come in the wrong order, if we get a
//! block that we don't have it's ancestors yet, we hold it until we have all ancestors.

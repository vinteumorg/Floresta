### Floresta

Welcome to Floresta, a lightweight Bitcoin full node implementation written in Rust, powered by [Utreexo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/611) a novel dynamic accumulator  designed for the Bitcoin UTXO set.

This project is composed of two parts, `libfloresta` and `florestad`. `libfloresta` is
a set of reusable components that can be used to build Bitcoin applications. `florestad` is built on top of `libfloresta` to provide a full node implementation, including a watch-only wallet and an Electrum server. If you just want to run a full node, you can use `florestad` directly, either by building it from source or by downloading a pre-built binary from the [releases](https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

If you want to use `libfloresta` to build your own Bitcoin application, you can find the documentation [here](https://docs.dlsouza.lol/floresta/).

### Building

You'll need Rust and Cargo, refer to [this](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for more details. Minimum support version is rustc 1.64 and newer.

Once you have Cargo, clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/Floresta.git
```

go to the Floresta directory

```bash
cd Floresta/
```

and build with cargo build

```bash
cargo build --release --bin florestad
# Optionally, you can add florestad to the path with
cargo install --path ./florestad
```

### Running
Right now, this project is working on signet only. Mainnet support is still a todo thing. You can get some signet coins [here](https://www.signetfaucet.com/) and just play around with it.
Copy `config.toml.sample` to `config.toml`, and fill up your xpubs and addresses that you intend to track, and then run with

```bash
florestad -c config.toml --network signet run
```

or

```bash
./target/release/florestad -c config.toml --network signet run
```

or

```bash
cargo run --release -- -c config.toml --network signet run
```

### Running the tests

#### Requirements

```bash
cargo build
```

There's a set of unit tests that you can run with
```bash
cargo test
```

There's also a set of functional tests that you can run with

```bash
pip3 install -r tests/requirements.txt
python tests/run_tests.py
```

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. There's not really a set of guidelines for contributing other than the code compiling and the tests passing. If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, take a look at the issues, there's a few of them marked as `good first issue`.

### Consensus implementation

One of the most challenging parts of working with Bitcoin is keeping up with the consensus rules. Given it's nature as a consensus protocol, it's very important to make sure that the implementation is correct. Instead of reimplementing a Script interpreter, we use [`rust-bitcoinconsensus`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoinconsensus/) to verify transactions. This is a bind around a shared library that is part of Bitcoin Core. This way, we can be sure that the consensus rules are the same as Bitcoin Core, at least for scripts.

Although tx validation is arguably the hardest part in this process. This integration can be further improved by using `libbitcoinkernel`, that will increase the scope of `libbitcoinconsensus` to outside scripts, but this is still a work in progress.

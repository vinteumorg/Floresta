### Floresta
**This is a WIP project, and should not be used with real money!**

This is a WIP for a wallet/node powered by utreexo. This codebase can download and parse blocks ~~(from a Utreexod cli)~~, find transactions we need to our wallet and do some basic consensus validation. The consensus part is incomplete, and should not be trusted yet.
This code also have an out-of-the-box Electrum Server that you can use with any wallet that supports it.

### Building
You'll need Rust and Cargo, refer to [this](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for more details. Minimum support version is rustc 1.64 and newer.

Once you have Cargo, clone the repository with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Davidson-Souza/utreexo-electrum-server
```
and build with cargo build
```bash
$ cd utreexo-electrum-server
$ cargo build --release
```

### Running
Right now, this project is working on signet only. Mainnet support is still a todo thing. You can get some signet coins [here] and just play around with it.
Copy `config.toml.sample` to `config.toml`, and fill up your xpubs and addresses that you intend to track, and then run with
```bash
$ floresta -c config.toml --network signet run
```
